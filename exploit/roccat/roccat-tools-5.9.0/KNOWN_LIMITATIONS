* The AlienFX compatible devices report all their lights, but support only one color
  for all. That's a function of the Windows software but also the firmware.
  For example the Nyth reports both it's lights but only the value of index 1 is
  applied to both.
  In Gfx I'm also reporting each light individually, but can't do anything to lift
  the firmware restrictions.
